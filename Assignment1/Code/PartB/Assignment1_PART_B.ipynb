        "\n",
        "In this assignment you will import and explore/analyze a dataset for classification. You will explore which ML algorithms are best to classify this and you will present your best solution. For this assignment we will use Human Activity dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Description of the dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.\n",

        "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters. From the procecced input sensors a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables is generated.\n",

        "\n",
        "At the end you have to hand in this notebook together with the notebooks of Assignment 1, when you hand it in you should make sure that you saved it with all output visible. So we can evaluate your notebooks output without directly ruinning it.\n",
